CXPROLOG INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
===============================

Installation of the source distribution
----------------------------------------

This builds the executable "cxprolog":

    cd src
    make

This checks if "cxprolog" operates correctly on your machine:

    make test

This installs "cxprolog" in "/usr/local/bin/" (may require 
superuser mode):

    make install

If you prefer to install "cxprolog" elsewhere, e.g. inside
"/usr/bin/", then you must change the PREFIX definition in file
"Makefile" before running "make install".

This removes all the "mess" created by the compiler:

    make clean


Enjoy using cxprolog.
