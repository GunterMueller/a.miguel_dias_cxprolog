CxProlog version 0.70

CxProlog is a simple WAM based Prolog system, extended with some features:
	- threads (Modula-2-like coroutines);
	- units (Modula-2-like modules)
	- contexts (cf. [L.Monteiro, A.Porto: "Contextual Logic Programming",
		in Proc. 6º ICLP, Lisboa, Portugal,MIT Press, 1989])

CxProlog is small and manageable, yet reasonably fast.

CxProlog is a compiler but provides an interpreter-like interface.

CxProlog is written in C. CxProlog has been tested on the Macintosh (using the
THINKC 5.0 compiler) and on some other machines running Unix (using the gcc
compiler): i386, R6000, Mips. It should be compatible with any 32 or 64 bit
machine with at least 3 bits available for tags in the data addresses. No
costumisation of the source code should be necessary. The CxProlog adjusts
itself to the machine where it runs.

The core of the supported system predicates are those described in
"Introduction to Logic Programming" by Clocksin, Springer Verlag).

CxProlog system is experimental software. There is no support for it,
neither documentation (besides the included "_README" file).

The main contributors with ideas for improving the CxProlog system was:
António Porto, Rui Marques, Tiago Antão.

Releases:

 000510: version 0.70
 	name change: "NanoProlog" was renamed as "CxProlog".
 	new files: too many to list here
 	files changed: Most files have changed. Many file names have changed.
 					For example, "NanoBoot.pl" was renamed as "CxBoot.pl".
	changes: * Complete system overhaul.
			 * Added support to units (modules). Units may have parameters.
			 * Added support to contexts: "Contextual Logic Programming".
			 * Added support to the declaration of imperative private local
			 	variables in the units: see predicates
			 					set_ivar/2, get_ivar/2 below.
			 * The sublanguage of the arithmetic expressions was enlarged:
				see description of predicate is/2 below.
			 * Error messages are now much improved.
			 * Handling of Control-C interrupt.
			 * Improved display of query results (CxBoot.pl).
				
			 * New generic method of binding the predicates to their code.
			 * New simpler technique of dealing with clause chains:
			  	two parallel chains not used anymore
			 * New improved ways of dealing with indexes: invalidation of
			 	the index when a predicate changes, relocation of the index
				code, etc, etc.
			 * Bug in predicate clause/2 fixed: now this predicate fails
			    immediately if applied to a builtin predicate.
			 * Bugs related to the use of trans-127 characters solved.
			 * TermRead can now deal with V E R Y  L A R G E terms.
			 
 000324: version 0.57
 	new files: TermExtra.c
 	files changed: All files have changed
	changes: * The whole program was made ANSI-conformant.
			 * Added general support for the addition of new primitive types:
				* new tag: 'extra'
				* new instructions: the 'Extra' instruction family
				* new predicate extra/1
			 * Added new primitive type 'text' (see descr. below) with
			  predicates: text/1, gett/1, putt/1, slicet/4, namet/2, concatt/2.
			 * Removed predicate gets/2.
			 * '`' changed from _SY to '`' (Now '`' is the delimiter 
			 	for the "text" literals).

 990627: version 0.56
 	files changed: System.c, TermChars.c, TermOp.c, TermRead.c, NanoBoot.pl,
					Stream.c, System.c
	changes: * "nonvar/1" bug fixed.
 			 * ';', '#' and other trans-127 chars changed from _SO to _SY.
			 * Following the CProlog "standard", in contexts where "|" did
			   not indicate "the reminder of a list" this char used to be
			   translated to ";". Now you are able to change this default
			   behaviour by forcing "|" to be interpreted as a regular binary
			   operator: use the command :- op(1140, xfx, '|'), for example.
			   (the flag "barOpDefined" was introduced for dealing with this.)
			 * [user] (consult(user)) bug fixed.
			 * New I/O preds (see descr. below): peek/1, puts/1, gets/1, gets/2
			 * New string pred (see descr. below): concats/2
			 * Removed predicates: noindex/1, noindex/2 (Nanoprolog got more
				clever and doesn't need to bother the user with indexing
				issues anymore.)
  
 970805: version 0.55
 	new file: TermChars.c
              * Introduced support for the Latin-1 character set.
 	files changed: NanoProlog.c, TermRead.c, TermWrite.c, NanoBoot.pl
	changes:  * Now, the name of the boot file is obtained from an (optional)
			   command line argument or from the sysvar "NANO". Only as last
			   resource an internally predefined name is used.
              * The Latin-1 character set is now supported by all the
			    i/o predicates.
              * Now, predicates 'consult' and 'reconsult' append the
			    suffix ".pl" to the file name (in case it is not already
			    there).
  
 970408: version 0.54
 	files changed: System.c, Interpreter.c, Compiler.c
	changes: * added support to the cut predicate (!/0) when used inside
                the system predicates: ,/2, ;/2, not/1, call/1, ->/2
                (new instruction: PutCutLevel)
             * new system predicate undef/0: it lists all
               the predicates invoked by the currently loaded code
               that are undefined.

	% possible results: 'going', 'completed', 'failed', 'killed', 'error'
actual_thread(-ThName)
kill_thread(+ThName)

TEXT (non-standard primitive type)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
% A 'text' is a compact transient representation of a portion of text.
% 'Texts' are well suited for dealing with large amounts of text:
   % Atoms are not so good at this because they are permanent entities;
   % Strings are transient entities too and, functionally, they are more
   %	flexible than 'texts'. However, a string element takes up 8 times
   %	the space required by a 'text' element, and processing 'text' elements
   %	is faster.

% 'Text' literals are delimited by backquotes as in `hello`. Compare:
    % "hello" is a string literal;
    % 'hello' is an atom literal;
    % hello   is also an atom literal;
    % `hello` is a text literal.

text(+T)			% checks if the argument is a 'text'
gett(-T)			% reads an entire line as a 'text'.
putt(+T)			% writes a 'text'. Ex:  puts(`ABC`) --> ABC
slicet(+T,+A,+B,-R)	% returns a 'subtext'.  Ex:  slicec(`ABC`,1,1,X) --> X=`A`
namet(?Atom,?T)		% 'text' version of name/2.
concatt(+List, ?T)	% 'text' version of concats/2.
