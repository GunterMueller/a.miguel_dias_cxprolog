Introduction

CxProlog is a WAM based Prolog system, extended with some features:
    - threads (Modula-2-like coroutines);
    - units (Modula-2-like modules)
    - contexts (cf. [L.Monteiro, A.Porto: "Contextual Logic Programming",
      in Proc. 6 ICLP, Lisboa, Portugal, MIT Press, 1989])
    - some imperative mechanisms: imperative variables (ivars),
                                  imperative queues,
                                  imperative stacks,
                                  imperative dictionaries,
                                  imperative arrays

CxProlog is small and manageable, yet reasonably fast.

CxProlog is a compiler but provides an interpreter-like interface.

CxProlog is written in C. CxProlog was tested on the Macintosh (using
the THINKC 5.0 compiler and the MPW development system) and on several
Unix machines using the gcc compiler: i386, R6000, Mips.
It should be compatible with any 32 or 64 bit machine with at least
3 bits available for tags in the data addresses. No customisation of
the source code is necessary, as CxProlog adjusts itself to the
machine where it runs.

The main builtin predicates of CxProlog are those described in
"Introduction to Logic Programming" by Clocksin, Springer Verlag.

CxProlog system is experimental software. As yet, there is no support
and this "MANUAL" file is the sole documentation available.

CxProlog Builtin Predicates

This section describes the CxProlog builtin predicates. The builtin
predicates are special because:
  - they are predefined;
  - they are visible to all the units;
  - they are usually immutable;
  - they are untraceable by the debugger;

In this document, each builtin is introduced using a generic goal
template, followed by a condensed description of its semantics.  As
an example, the goal template corresponding to the builtin predicate
'functor/3' is:
                        functor(?T,?A,?N)

In a goal template, the symbols preceding the parameters have the
following interpretation:

   +   Input parameter. The actual argument instantiates the parameter.
   -   Output parameter. The actual argument is matched against the
       parameter.
   ?   Input/Output parameter. The actual argument can be used both ways.

Also, in a goal template, the name of the parameters reflect
their type, according to the following table:

      A - atom
      B - buffer (special datatype)
      D - dictionary or array (special datatypes)
      F - filename (atom)
      G - goal to be proved
      K - stack (special datatype)
      L - list
      N - number (integer or float)
      P - process (special datatype only available in Unix)
      Q - queue (special datatype)
      S - stream (special datatype)
      T - general term
      U - unit designator (term)
      Z - thread (special datatype)

The sophisticated user can add extra builtin predicates and redefine
existing predefined builtin predicates. The section "Customizing CxProlog"
explains how this is done.

Most of the CxProlog builtin predicates conform to:

    - Clocksin: "Introduction to Logic Programming", Springer Verlag.
    - L.Monteiro, A.Porto: "Contextual Logic Programming",
                in Proc. 6 ICLP, Lisboa, Portugal, MIT Press, 1989.

CONTROL
~~~~~~~
+G1,+G2             % Conjunction. Proves G1 and G2.
+G1;+G2             % Disjunction. Proves G1 or G2.
!                   % Cut. When encountered as a goal, it commits the
                    %   predicate where it occurs to the choices made
                    %   since that predicate was last activated. Note that
                    %   there is special support for the cut occurring in the
                    %   context of goals with the following main functors:
                    %       call/1, not/1, +/1, ->/2, ;/2, ,/2, <>/2, >>/2,
                    %       >/1, </1, try/1, once/2, possible/2, gen/2,
                    %       call_on_empty_context/1
                    %   Only "compiled cuts" work. For example, the goal
                    %   "X=!, call(X)" generates the runtime error:
                    %       {ERROR (!/0): Dynamic '!/0' is not supported.}
call(+G)            % Proves goal G.
call(+A,+L)         % Defined as call(A,L) :- X =.. [A|L], X.
+G                  % Same as call(+G).
not +G              % Goal G is not provable (that is G fails).
\+ +G               % Same as not G.
try +G              % Always succeeds deterministically, either with the first
                    %   solution for G, if one exists, or otherwise with G
                    %   unchanged. Except for the occurrence of cuts in G,
                    %   this predicate could be defined as:
                    %                     try G :- G, ! ; true.
once +G             % Succeeds deterministically with the first solution to G
                    %   if and only if there exists at least one. Except for
                    %   the occurrence of cuts in G, this predicate could be
                    %   defined as: once G :- G, !.
possible +G         % Succeeds deterministically if and only if there is at
                    %   least one solution to G. The current instantiation
                    %   state of G is not changed. Except for occurrence of
                    %   cuts in G, the predicate could be defined as:
                    %                 possible G :- not not G.
gen +G              % Explores all the alternatives in the goal G and, at
                    %   the end, succeeds with the current instantiation
                    %   state of G unchanged. Except for occurrence of cuts
                    %   in G, this predicate could be defined as:
                    %                   gen G :- G, fail ; true.
+G1->+G2;+G3        % Conditional goal. If G1 succeeds prove G2; if not,
                    %   prove G3.
+G1->+G2            % Same as (G1->G2;false). But if the "compatible_if_then"
                    %   flag is 'off', it becomes equivalent to (G1->G2;true)
                    %   which is more sound logically.
true                % Succeeds.
fail                % Fails.
false               % Same as fail.
repeat              % Succeeds repeatedly on backtracking.
repeat(+N)          % Succeeds repeatedly on backtracking exactly N times.
                    %   After that fails.
repeat(+N1,-N2)     % Like repeat(N1) and the succession 1, 2, 3, ..., N1
                    %   is generated via N2 on backtracking.
restart             % Restarts CxProlog execution. The execution stacks are
                    %   cleared, but the internal database remains unchanged.
abort               % Same as restart/0.
halt                % Terminates CxProlog execution displaying the message
                    %   "CxProlog halted".
exit                % Exits from CxProlog, displaying no message.
question(+G,+L)     % Implements the top-level queries of the predefined
                    %   top-level user-iteration. Also implements the '?-G'
                    %   questions inside the consult/reconsult predicates.
findall(+T,+G,-L)   % L is unified with the list (not ordered an possibly
                    %   containing duplicates) of all the instances of template
                    %   T for which G is provable. All free variable
                    %   (those contained in G and not in T) are considered
                    %   to be existentially quantified.
bagof(+T,+G,-L)     % L is unified with the list (not ordered an possibly
                    %   containing duplicates) of all the instances of template
                    %   T for which G is provable. The predicate fails if G
                    %   fails for every instance of T. If G is of the form
                    %   X^T, where X is a variable, then X is treated as being
                    %   existentially quantified in T. G must not be an
                    %   uninstantiated variable.
setof(+T,+G,-L)     % Like bagof except that the returned list L is free from
                    %   duplicates.
catch(+ProtectedGoal,?Pattern,+HandlerGoal)  
					% This is equivalent to ProtectedGoal, unless an exception
						is thrown while ProtectedGoal is being proved. In this
						case all the bindings made by ProtectedGoal are undone,
						like it had failed. Then Pattern is unified with
						the term representing the exception. If this unification
						succeeds, the exception is said to have been "caught"
						and HandlerGoal is executed, in fact replacing the
						execution of ProtectedGoal. If the unification fails,
						the system looks for an ancestor of the current goal
						that would handle the exception; if it cannot find any
						such handler, the system activates a default "catch-all"
						handler that acts by printing a description of the
						exception.
catch(+ProtectedGoal,?Pattern,-StackTrace,+HandlerGoal)  
					% Similar to catch/3 except that a stack trace of the
						current execution environment is built and returned in
						the parameter StackTrace. A "stack trace" is a
						list representing the current execution context at the
						point where the exception was raised.
						IMPORTANT LIMITATION: Due to certain optimization
						issues, part of the information concerning the
						history of the computation is unavailable at runtime,
						in CxProlog. This implies that, usually, some items
						will be missing from the stack trace. If complete stack
						traces are crucial, then the flag 'lco_optimization'
						should be turned off before consulting the program of
						interest. Note that this is only acceptable at
						development time, when writing and testing a new
						Prolog application. Definitively this is not acceptable
						at production time, when running the final application.
throw(+ExceptionTerm)
                    % Explicitly throws an exception. ExceptionTerm can be any
						term except a free variable.
						NOTE: All non-fatal errors, that might arise during the
						execution ofprograms, manifest themselves by throwing
						exceptions.
on_exception(?Pattern,+ProtectedGoal,+HandlerGoal)  
                    % This is a Quintus-Prolog compatibility predicate.
						Equivalent to
						      catch(+ProtectedGoal,?Pattern,+HandlerGoal).
						Note the different argument order.
raise_exception(+Exception)						
                    % This is a Quintus-Prolog compatibility predicate.
						Identical to throw/1.

COMPARING TERMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A total ordering, called "standard order" and denoted by @<, is defined
over the set of all Prolog terms. Most predicates in this section are
concerned with this ordering.

+T1 == +T2          % T1 and T2 are literally identical.
+T1 \== +T2         % T1 and T2 are not literally identical.
+T1 @< +T2          % T1 is before T2 in the standard order.
+T1 @> +T2          % T1 is before T2 in the standard order.
+T1 @=< +T2         % T1 is not after T2 in the standard order.
+T1 @>= +T2         % T1 is not before T2 in the standard order.
sort(+L1,-L2)       % Quicksorts list L1 into L2. Duplicates are removed.
msort(+L1,-L2)      % Quicksorts list L1 into L2.
keysort(+L1,-L2)    % Quicksorts list L1 into L2. Items of L1 must have
                    %   the form Key-Value.

ARITHMETIC
~~~~~~~~~~
These are the predicates that deal with the evaluation of arithmetic
expressions. At the time of evaluation, each logic variable in an
arithmetic expression is expected to be bound to some number or to
some arithmetic expression.

-N is +Exp          % Evaluates Exp as an arithmetic expression and unifies
                    %   the result with N. The result of the evaluation is
                    %   automatically converted to an integral value
                    %   whenever its decimal part is zero or almost zero.
+T1 =:= +T2         % T1 and T2 evaluate to the same number.
+T1 =\= +T2         % T1 and T2 do not evaluate to the same number.
+T1 < +T2           % The value of T1 is lesser than the value of T2.
+T1 > +T2           % The value of T1 is greater than the value of T2.
+T1 =< +T2          % The value of T1 is not greater than the value of T2.
+T1 >= +T2          % The value of T1 is not less than the value of T2.
succ(?N1,?N2)       % The non-negative integer N2 is the successor of the
                    %   non-negative integer N1.

Syntax of the arithmetic expressions:

Exp ::=
    cputime         heapused        pi             inf
    max_int         min_int         int_size       float_size
    Exp + Exp       Exp - Exp       - Exp
    Exp * Exp       Exp / Exp       Exp mod Exp     Exp ^ Exp
    sqrt(Exp)       exp(Exp)        log(Exp)        log10(Exp)
    Exp >> Exp      Exp << Exp      Exp // Exp      Exp /\ Exp
    Exp \/ Exp      \ Exp           ceil(Exp)       floor(Exp)
    round(Exp)		sin(Exp)        cos(Exp)        tan(Exp)
	asin(Exp)		acos(Exp)       atan(Exp)       [Exp]

floor(X) - largest integral value not greater than X
ceil(X) - smallest integral value not less than X
round(X) - round X to the nearest integer, away from zero.

'inf' is a special number that is larger than any other number.
'inf' stands for "infinite". Here are some of its properties:
      N<inf, for any number N
      -inf<N, for any number N
      1/inf =:= 0
      1/0 =:= inf
      inf/0 =:= inf
      inf + 1 =:= inf
      inf * inf =:= inf
      inf =:= inf

[Exp] is allowed only if the flag 'compatible_strings' is 'on'. For
      example "a" =:= [97].

UNITS/CONTEXTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In CxProlog, every goal is proved in relation to a CURRENT CONTEXT, which
is a stack of unit designators. We call CURRENT UNIT the unit designated
by the unit designator at the top of the current context. There is no
current unit when the current context is empty. An extra HISTORIC CONTEXT
where entire contexts can be pushed was included for further flexibility.

When a predicate is invoked and, in the current unit, there is no matching
local nor imported definition available, the units below the current unit
are sequentially searched, from top to bottom. If a suitable visible
definition is found then the execution of the predicate proceeds in the

                    %   be corrected.

*** SAMPLING UNIT DEFINITION.
This is a simple sampling unit definition. Notice the visibility
declarations, the import declarations and the use of a parametrized unit:
-----
unit a(P).
visible [xxx/0, yyy/0, ccc/0].
import vvv/0 from d(222).

xxx :- show_context, writeln('xxx: I am the a/0 version').
ccc :- show_context, xxx.
yyy :- unit_param(1,X), writeln(X).
zzz :- P>>context(X), writeln(X).
s:- v := [1,2,Z].
g(X) :- v =: X.

PROGRAM DATA BASE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some of these predicates allow the program to be modified while running.
Some other predicates allow information about the state of the program
to be gathered.

assert(+T)          % Clause T is asserted at the beginning of the current
                    %   unit. This predicate invokes a fast compiler
                    %   (written in C) that generates code for the
                    %   CxProlog virtual machine.
asserta(+T)         % Same as assert(+T).
assertz(+T)         % Asserts the clause T at the ending of the current
                    %   unit.
clause(+T1,-T2)     % Matches T1 and T2 with the head and body of a clause
                    %   in the current unit. This predicate can be used to
                    %   generate, through backtracking, all the clauses in
                    %   the current unit.
retract(+T)         % Erases from the current unit the first clause
                    %   matching T.

                    %   heads match T.
abolish(+A,+N)      % Deletes the predicate A/N from the current unit. The

                    % Deletes the predefined builtin predicate A/N. This
                    %   predicate is offered as a tool for the sophisticated
                    %   user who wants to create an "ALTERNATIVE BOOT FILE".
mutable_builtin(+A,+N)   % ONLY WORKS AT BOOT TIME.
                    % Makes the user-defined builtin predicate A/N a
                    %   mutable predicate. Any ':-mutable_builtin(A,N)'
                    %   command must precede the definition of predicate
                    %   A/N. abolish/2 clears all the clauses  of a mutable

INPUT/OUTPUT - DEC-10 Prolog compatibility text streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Predicates see/1 and tell/1 take filenames as arguments and
predicates seeing/1 and telling/1 return filenames. The remaining
predicates act over the current input or the current output streams.

see(+F)             % The file F is opened (if not already open) and is
                    %   made the current input stream.
seeing(-F)          % Gets the filename of the current input stream.
seen                % Closes the current input stream.
read(-T)            % Reads the next term from the current input stream. At
                    %   end of file, the atom 'end_of_file' is returned.
                    %   (The names of the variables in the term T can be
                    %   gathered using varnames/1.)
varnames(-L)        % L is a list of pairs Var=Name, telling the names of
                    %   all the variables in the last term returned by
                    %   read/1, read/2 or atom_term/2.
read_tokens(-L)     % Reads an entire line of text as a list of tokens
                    %   [token = atomic lexical element]. If the line is
                    %   empty then the empty list is returned. At
                    %   end of file, the atom 'end_of_file' is returned.
get0(-N)            % Gets the ASCII code of the next char from the current
                    %   input stream. At end of file, the code specified by the
                    %   eof_code flag is returned.
get(-N)             % Gets the ASCII code of the next printing char from
                    %   the current input stream. End of file is denoted
                    %   by the value associated with the eof_code flag.
get_line(-A)        % Reads an entire line of text as an atom. At end of
                    %   file returns the code specified by the eof_code flag.

peek(-N)            % Similar to get(-N),  but it does not consume the
                    %   returned char.
skip(+N)            % Skips over chars in the current input stream until
                    %   the first occurrence of the char with code N.

tell(+F)            % The file F is opened (if not already open) and made
                    %   the current output stream.
telling(-F)         % Gets the filename of the current output stream.
told                % Closes the current output stream.

writeln(+T)         % Variant of write(+T) which outputs an extra
                    %   newline char.
writeq(+T)          % Variant of write(+T) which quotes atoms where
                    %    necessary so that read/1 could read the term back.
writeqln(+T)        % Variant of writeq(+T) which outputs an extra
                    %   newline char.
print(+T)           % By default, print/1 is equivalent to write/1, but this
						can be changed by providing clauses for the user
						predicate portray/1: print/1 calls portray/1 before
						deciding what to do. If portray/1 succeeds, then it
						assumes the argument term has been printed. If portray/1
						fails and the term is atomic, then it writes the term
						using write/1. If portray/1 fails and the term is
						compound, then it writes the principal functor of the
						term using write/1 and them calls itself recursively on
						the arguments of the term. These rules do not apply
						to variables: print/1 uses write/1 to print them
						immediatly.
display(+T)         % Writes term to stream user_output, ignoring operators.
displayln(+T)       % Variant of display(+T) which outputs an extra
                    %   newline char.

write_depth(+N1,+N2)% Sets the maximum term depth and the maximum list
                    %   length used by predicates write/1, write/2, etc.
                    %   0 (zero) means no limit. The initial values are
                    %   respectively 30 and 999.

INPUT/OUTPUT - Text File Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the following predicates, S stands for a stream (a new kind of
primitive type), or for an ivar bound to a stream.

Most of the predicates of this section require an explicit stream argument.

The predefined streams are denoted by 'user_input', 'user_output',
'user_error' and 'user'. 'user' represents 'user_input' or 'user_output',
depending on the context.

A stream can be associated to a file - if the stream is created using open/3 -
or to a socket - if the stream is created using net_accept/2.

** Linux dependent character encodings **
Any Linux supported character encoding can be associated to a newly created
stream (using open/4). The selected encoding is specified using a Linux locale,
e.g. 'en_US.iso885915', 'en_US.utf8', 'pt_PT.iso885915@euro' or
'sr_YU.iso88595@cyrillic'. Beware! As now CxProlog suffers from one severe
limitation: internally, CxProlog knows only how to handle internally characters
with Unicode code less or equal 255: all the other characters are implicitly
converted to the conventional character '?' (which has code 63). 

stream(+S)          % S is a valid active stream.
open(+F,+M,-S)      % The file specified by F is opened as a text stream (if not
                    %   already open) and the corresponding stream object
                    %   is returned in S. Mode M is one of following atoms:
                    %   'read', 'write', 'append'. The character encoding that
					%   becomes associated with the stream is the default
					%	encoding, as defined in the current locale Linux
					%	environment.
open(+F,+M,+E,-S)   % Similar the open/3 except that an explicit character
					%	encoding can be specified using an atom E. Any
					%	Linux supported character encoding can be used, e.g.
					%	'en_US.utf8' or 'pt_PT.iso885915@euro'. The atom 'text'
					%	is also supported as argument, standing for the default
					%	encoding, as defined in the current locale Linux
					%	environment.
file specified by F is opened as a text stream (if not
                    %   already open) and the corresponding stream object
                    %   is returned in S. Mode M is one of following atoms:
                    %   'read', 'write', 'append'. The character encoding that
					%   becomes associated with the stream is the encoding
					%   specified by the current locale Linux environment.
close(+S)           % Closes the stream S.

set_input(+S)       % Makes stream S the current input stream.
current_input(-S)   % Gets the current input stream.
read(+S,-T)         % Reads term from the input stream S. At end of file,
                    %   the atom 'end_of_file' is returned. (The names of
                    %   all the vars in the term T can be gathered using
                    %   varnames/1.) 
read_tokens(+S,-L)  % Reads from S an entire line of text as a list of
                    %   tokens [token = atomic lexical element]. If the
                    %   line is empty then the empty list is returned. At
                    %   end of file, the atom 'end_of_file' is returned.
get0(+S,-N)         % Gets the ASCII code of the next char from
                    %   stream S. At end of file, the code specified by the
                    %   eof_code flag is returned.
get(+S,-N)          % Gets the ASCII code of the next printing char from S.
                    %   End of file is denoted by the value associated with the
					%   eof_code flag.
get_line(+S,-A)     % Reads an entire line as an atom. At end of file returns
                    %    the code specified by the eof_code flag.
peek0(+S,-N)        % Similar to get0(+S,-N), but it does not consume the
                    %   returned char.
peek(+S,-N)         % Similar to get(+S,-N),  but it does not consume the
                    %   returned char.
skip(+S,+N)         % Skips over chars in the current input stream until
                    %   the first occurrence of the char with code N.

set_output(+S)      % Makes stream S the current output stream.
current_output(-S)  % Gets the current output stream.
flush(+S)           % Flushes the low-level buffer of the current output stream.
write(+S,+T)        % Writes the term T to the output stream S.
writeln(+S,+T)      % Variant of write(+S,+T) which outputs an extra
                    %   newline char.
writeq(+S,+T)       % Variant of write(+S,+T) which quotes atoms where
                    %    necessary) so that read/2 could read the term back.
writeqln(+S,+T)     % Variant of writeq(+S,+T) which outputs an extra
                    %   newline char.
print(+S,+T)        % By default, print/2 is equivalent to write/2, but this can
					    be changed by providing clauses for the user predicate
					    portray/1. portray/1 can assume that during the
						execution of print/2, the current output stream is
						temporarily set to stream S. More details about print/2
						in the entry for print/1.
put(+S,+N)          % Writes the char with code N to the output stream S.
nl(+S)              % Writes a newline to the output stream S.
tab(+S,+N)          % Writes N spaces to the output stream S.
get_user_streams(-S1,-S2,-S3)
                    % Gets the streams denoted by user_input, user_output
                    %   and user_error.
set_user_streams(+S1,+S2,+S3)
                    % Replaces the three user streams: user_input, user_output,
                    %   and user_error. Useful for redirecting input and
                    %   output already committed to the user streams.
streams             % Shows details about all the currently open streams.

       * Two new predicates set_user_streams/3, restore_user_streams/0
         allow the three user streams (user_input, user_output, user_error)
         to be replaced. This allows, for example, the usual top-level
         interaction to be performed through an Internet connection.
         This  also allows the error messages to be redirected to a
         log file.

INPUT/OUTPUT - Binary File Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Besides text file streams, CxProlog also supports binary file streams. Some of
the predicated described in the two previous sections are compatible with binary
file streams.

Binary file streams are created using open/4, closed using close/1 and
processed using get0/1, get0/2, peek0/1, peek0/2, put/1 and put/2.

There are also two block oriented predicates - get_block/3 and put_block/2 -,
that allow binary stream to be processed in large chunks, or even in just one
big chunk and in the following example.

Example: The predicate copy_file_in_one_go/1 implements file copying by
transfering all the data in just one big chunk:

		copy_file_in_one_go(FName,GName) :-
			fs_property(FName,size,FSize),
			buffer_new(Buff),
			open(FName,read,binary,F), get_block(F,Buff,FSize), close(F),
			open(GName,write,binary,G), put_block(G,Buff), close(G),
			buffer_delete(Buff).

Important note: the end-of-file code for binary file streams is -1, and this
cannot be changed, unlike the end-of-file code for text file streams.
                                                                               

open(+F,+M,+E,-S)   % The file specified by F is opened as a stream (if not
                    %   already open) and the corresponding stream object
                    %   is returned in S. Mode M is one of following atoms:
                    %   'read', 'write', 'append'. The parameter E must be the
					%	atom 'binary', in order to create a binary stream.
get_block(+S,+B,+N) % Reads N bytes from the binary stream S into the buffer B.
					%	The previous contents of the buffer is destroyed.
					%	If the end of file is encountered, the actual number
					%	of transfered bytes can be lower than N. To find out
					%	the exact number of transfered bytes use the
					%	goal buffer_size(B,X,X).
put_block(+S,+B)	% Writes the entire contents of the buffer B to the
					%	binary stream S.

INPUT/OUTPUT - Buffer Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The predicate open_buffer_stream/3 opens a stream over a buffer. All the
existing input/output operations are compatible with buffer streams.

As now, opening two streams over the same buffer is not supported: the behaviour
of both streams is not defined.

Important note: the end-of-file code for buffer streams is -1, and this cannot
be changed.

open_buffer_stream(+B,+M,-S)
					% The buffer B is opened as a stream and the corresponding
					%   stream object is returned in S. Mode M is one of
					%	following atoms: 'read', 'write', 'append'.

INPUT/OUTPUT - Null Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A null stream is an outout stream that throws away characters and terms written
to it. Null streams are created using open_null_stream/1, closed using close/1,
and any output operation can be applied to them.

open_null_stream(-S)
                    % Creates a new null stream which is returned in S.

OS SERVICES
~~~~~~~~~~~
The following predicates provide direct access to certain operating
systems services.

NOTE: Most of these predicates only work under Unix and Classic MacOS
(versions 7.x, 8.x, 9.x). Under other operating systems they fail.

os_name(-A)         % Gets the name of the underlying operating system.
                    %   As yet, the possible results are:
                    %             'unix', 'mac', 'unknown'
os_run(+A)          % Runs command A. Succeeds in case of successful
                    %   command completion.
system(+A)          % Dec10-Prolog/C-Prolog compatibly predicate.
                    %   Identical to os_run/1.
sh                  % Dec10-Prolog/C-Prolog compatibly predicate.
                    %   Identical to os_run('sh').
os_env(+A,-A)       % Accesses environment variables.
                    %   Example: os_env('PATH',X)
os_arg(+A,-A)       % Gets individual command line arguments.
                    %   Example: os_arg('-boot',X)
os_args(-L)         % Gets entire command line as a list of atoms.
                    %   Example: os_args(X)

FILE SYSTEM
~~~~~~~~~~~
The hierarchic file system can be examined and changed using the
predicates in this section.

FILENAMES are atoms.

The CURRENT DIRECTORY (an absolute path) is represented as a reversed
list of filenames. This is an OS independent representation. Examples:
   - Unix: "/usr/bin/ls" ---> CxProlog: [ls,bin,usr]
   - Unix: "/"           ---> CxProlog: []
   - MacOS: "HD20:Appl"  ---> CxProlog: ['Appl','HD20']
   - MacOS: "HD20"       ---> CxProlog: ['HD20']

MACOS SPECIFIC NOTE: Under MacOS, CxProlog introduces a "virtual root",
denoted by the empty list [], where all the currently mounted volumes
are logically placed. Therefore, when the current directory is the
"virtual root", the predicate fs_files/1 returns the names of all the
currently mounted volumes (which are, therefore, treated as ordinary
directories).

Follows the complete list of file system predicates:

*** The following predicates work under every operating system:

fs_exists(+F)       % Checks if there is a file/dir named F.
fs_rename(+Fo,+Fn)  % Renames existing file/dir Fo as Fn. If Fn is the
                    %   empty list [] then Fo is deleted.
fs_delete(+F)       % Deletes existing file/dir F. Only empty directories
                    %   can be deleted.

file_exists(+F)     % Quintus-Prolog compatibility predicate.
                    %   Identical to fs_exists/1.
rename_file(+Fo,+Fn)% Quintus-Prolog compatible predicate.
                    %   Identical to fs_rename/2.
delete_file(+F)     % Quintus-Prolog compatibly predicate.
                    %   Identical to fs_delete/2.

exists(+F)          % Dec10-Prolog/C-Prolog compatibly predicate.
                    %   Identical to fs_exists/1.
rename(+Fo,+Fn)     % Dec10-Prolog/C-Prolog compatibly predicate.
                    %   Identical to fs_rename/2.

*** The following predicates work only under Unix and Classic MacOS
    (versions 7.x, 8.x, 9.x). Under other operating systems
    they return dummy results, such as the empty list [], or
    they fail.

fs_property(+F,+A,-R)
                    % R is the value of the property A of existing
                    % file/dir F. As yet, the supported properties are:
                    %     PROPERTY      POSSIBLE RESULTS
                    %      type          'file', 'dir'
                    %      size          the size of the file in bytes
                    %      readable      'false', 'true'
fs_cd(-L)           % Obtains the current directory.
fs_cd(-Lo,+Ln)      % Changes the current directory from Lo to Ln.
fs_home             % Resets the current directory.
fs_files(-L)        % Gets all files/dirs inside the current directory.

FLAGS
~~~~~
"The flags" are some internal system flags which allows certain aspects of
the behaviour of CxProlog to be modified. 

flag(+A,-T)         % Queries the value of flag A. Possible values are
                    %    'on', 'off' or an integer in a range that
                    %    depends on each particular flag.
flag(+A,-To,+Tn)    % Changes the value of flag A. The old value of A is
                    %    To and the new value is Tn. Possible values are
                    %    'on', 'off' or an integer in a range that
                    %    depends on each particular flag.
flags               % Shows the current status of all CxProlog flags.

Description of the flags:

debug               - Controls the current debugger working mode.
                        Allowed range is 0-2:
                         0 - debugger is off;
                         1 - debugger is in "debug" mode;
                         2 - debugger is in "trace" mode.
                         DEFAULT=0.
interrupt           - Controls the effects of a CTRL-C interrupt.
                        Allowed range is 0-4.
                         O - interrupt is ignored;
                         1 - interrupt activates "debug" mode;
                         2 - interrupt activates "trace" mode;
                         3 - interrupt aborts the current execution;
                         4 - interrupt presents a menu of possible actions.
                         DEFAULT=2.
fail_on_error       - Allows runtime errors to produce "failure" instead of
                        "restart". Allowed range is 0-2:
                         0 - errors generate restart;
                         1 - errors generate failure, but the error messages
                             are displayed anyway;
                         2 - errors generate failure and the error messages
                             are suppressed.
                         DEFAULT=0.
compatible_if_then  - If 'on', (G1->G2) is equivalent to (G1->G2;false)
                        as in most Prologs. If 'off', (G1->G2) is
                        equivalent to (G1->G2;true), which is more
                        sound logically. DEFAULT=on.
compatible_strings  - If 'on', any double-quoted literal, like "hello", is
                        interpreted as a list of ascii codes (which,
                        sometimes, is also a valid evaluable expression
                        -- see is/2). If 'off', any double-quoted literal
                        is interpreted as an application of functor '""'/1
                        to some Prolog term. Example: "1.3" --> '""'(1.3).
bar_is_semicolon    - If 'on', the atom '|' is automatically translated
                        to the atom ';' (except in contexts where '|'
                        is denoting "the reminder of a list"). If 'off' no
                        translation is performed. DEFAULT=on.
eof_code            - Specifies the end-of-file code for text files. -1 achieves
                        compatibility with Quintus Prolog. 26 achieves
						compatibility with C-Prolog. DEFAULT=-1
keep_source         - If 'on', the clauses are internally stored in
                        double format: "compiled format" and "source
                        format". This is a bit redundant but predicates
                        clause/2, retract/1 and listing/1 will only work
                        with predicates asserted at a time this flag is
                        'on'. Setting this flag to 'off' saves around 40%
                        of database space (in subsequent asserts or
                        consults). DEFAULT=on.
lco_optimization    - If 'on', every newly asserted or consulted clause is
						compiled with the last-call optimization enabled.
						If 'off', it is compiled with the last-call optimization
						disabled. DEFAULT=on.
						EXPLANATION: Like every modern Prolog, CxProlog supports 
						the last-call optimization. This optimization consists
						in deallocating the clause's environment before the
						clause's last goal is called, and arranging for the
						called predicate to return not to its caller but to its
						caller's caller. By disabling this optimization one
						should expect two terrible things: (1) the speed of
						CxProlog to be halved; (2) the runtime stack consumption
						of CxProlog to be increased by a factor of ten or more,
						depending on each program. Therefore do keep this flag
						always 'on', unless you desperately need the builtin
						predicate catch/4 to produce fully informative
						"stack traces".						
undef_warnings      - If 'on', a warning is issued whenever an undefined
                        predicate is invoked. Useful for debugging.
                        DEFAULT=on.
memory_warnings     - If 'on', a warning message is issued whenever an
                        internal "elastic buffer" automatically grows.
                        Useful to be aware of the rate of memory
                        consumption. DEFAULT=on.
garbage_collection  - Controls whether the garbage collector of atoms
                        is active or not. DEFAULT=on.
index_params        - States how many parameters should be used in
                        building predicate indexes. Allowed range is
                        0..3, 0 meaning no predicate indexing
                        is required. DEFAULT=1.
float_display_precision - Controls how floats are displayed.
                        If > 0, they are displayed with at least the
                        indicated number of significant digits and
                        using either decimal notation or scientific
                        notation, whichever is shorter.
                        If <= 0, they are displayed with exactly the
                        indicated number of decimal places in decimal
                        notation. DEFAULT=6.
sys_trace           - Sets the desired level of detail of the info produced by
                        the low-level runtime tracer. Allowed range is 0-3:
                         0 - disable the low-level runtime tracer;
                         1 - show all builtin predicate calls;
                         2 - show all predicate calls;
                         3 - show the complete trace of the execution of the
                             prolog machine.
						DEFAULT=0. All the debugging output is placed in the
						file 'sys_trace.log'. Beware, this file can grow very
						large.					 
test_rellocation      - If 'on', activates a self-testing mode that makes
                        the rellocation algorithms of the self-expanding
                        control stacks (global, local, trail e finalizers)
                        run continuously.
                        DEFAULT=off.
test_garbage_collection - If 'on', activates a self-testing mode that makes
                        the garbage collector of atoms run continuously.
                        DEFAULT=off.


IMPERATIVE VARIABLES (IVARS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An "ivar" is a special name that can be freely bound/rebound to different
Prolog terms using the "assignment operator" :=/2. The effects of the
assignment operator are not automatically reversed on backtracking.

CxProlog predefines the following ivars:
       'user_input', 'user_output', 'user_error', 'user'.

ivar(+A)            % A is an existing ivar.
+A := +T            % Sets ivar A to T. The ivar A is automatically 
                    %   created if necessary. Always succeeds.
+A =: -T            % Gets the current value of ivar A. Fails in case
                    %   A does not exist.
+A ?:= +T           % Creates and sets ivar A to T only if A does not
                    %   exist already. Nothing is done if A already
                    %   exists. Always succeeds.
+A #:= +T           % Sets the ivar A to T and makes it a CONSTANT. The
                    %   ivar A is automatically created if it does not
                    %   exist already.
ivar_delete(+A)     % Deletes the ivar A, if it exists.
current_ivar(-A,-T) % Generates (through backtracking)  all the existing
                    %    ivars and the corresponding values.
ivars               % Shows all the existing ivars and corresponding values.

IMPERATIVE QUEUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the following predicates, Q stands for a queue (a new kind of primitive
type) or for an ivar bound to a queue.

A queue can store terms of any kind: for example it can mix integers,
queues and dictionaries. The queues are "imperative" in the sense that
the effects of the queue operations are not automatically undone
on backtracking.

queue(+Q)           % Q is a queue.
queue_new(-Q)       % Creates a new queue Q.
queue_clear(+Q)     % Clears the queue Q.
queue_delete(+Q)    % Deletes the queue Q.
queue_put(+Q,+T)    % Puts the term T at the end of the queue Q.
queue_get(+Q,-T)    % Gets the term T from the front of the queue Q.
queue_peek(+Q,-T)   % Examines the front of the queue Q.
queue_write(+Q)     % Writes info about Q to the current output stream.
queue_write(+S,+Q)  % Writes info about Q to the stream S.
queue_as_list(+Q,-L)% Converts the queue Q to a list L of terms.
current_queue(-Q)   % Generates (through backtracking) all the
                    %   existing queues.
queues              % Shows all existing queues.

IMPERATIVE STACKS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the following predicates, K stands for a stack (a new kind of primitive
type) or for an ivar bound to a stack.

A stack can store terms of any kind: for example it can mix integers,
queues and dictionaries. The stacks are "imperative" in the sense that
the effects of the stack operations are not automatically undone on
backtracking.

stack(+K)           % K is a stack.
stack_new(-K)       % Creates a new stack K.
stack_clear(+K)     % Clears the stack K.
stack_delete(+K)    % Deletes the stack K.
stack_push(+K,+T)   % Pushes the term T on the stack K.
stack_pop(+K,-T)    % Pops term T from the stack K.
stack_top(+K,-T)    % Examines the top of the stack K.
stack_write(+K)     % Writes info about K to the current output stream.
stack_write(+S,+K)  % Writes info about K to the stream S.
stack_as_list(+K,-L)% Converts the stack K to a list L of terms.
current_stack(-K)   % Generates (through backtracking) all the
                    %   existing stacks.
stacks              % Shows all existing stacks.

IMPERATIVE DICTIONARIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the following predicates, D stands for a dict (a new kind of primitive
type) or for an ivar bound to a dict.

A dict is a heterogeneous contained that can store terms of any kind,
indexed by terms of any kind. A dict is "imperative" in the sense that the
effects of the dict operations are not automatically undone on backtracking.

Each key has a single value associated. So the retrieve predicate,
dict_get/3, is deterministic.

The dicts are kept automatically sorted so that the items could be
retrieved through binary search.

dict(+D)            % D is a dictionary.
dict_new(-D)        % Creates a new dictionary D.
dict_clear(+D)      % Clears the dict D.
dict_delete(+D)     % Deletes the dict D.
dict_set(+D,+Key,+T)% Associates the term T with the key Key in the
                    %   dictionary D.
dict_get(+D,+Key,-T)% Gets T associated with Key in dictionary D.
dict_delete_item(+D,+Key)
                    % Deletes the key Key from the dictionary D.
dict_write(+D)      % Writes info about D to the current output stream.
dict_write(+S,+D)   % Writes info about D to the stream S.
dict_as_list(+D,-L) % Converts the dictionary D to a list L of K-T pairs.
current_dict(-D)    % Generates (through backtracking) all the existing
                    %   dicts.
dicts               % Shows all existing dictionaries.

IMPERATIVE ARRAYS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the following predicates, D stands for an array (a new kind of primitive
type) or for an ivar bound to an array.

An array is a specialized dictionary which is indexed by (small) positive
integers, starting at 1. An array grows automatically, as needed.
The store and retrieve operations are very fast and performed in
constant time.

array(+D)            % D is a array.
array_new(-D)        % Creates a new array D.
array_clear(+D)      % Clears the array D.
array_delete(+D)     % Deletes the array D.
array_set(+D,+Idx,+T)% Associates the term T with the index Idx in the
                     %   array D.
array_get(+D,+Idx,-T)% Gets T associated with Idx in array D. Fails if there
                     % is no term associated with index Idx in D.
array_delete_item(+D,+Idx)
                     % Deletes the term at Idx from the array D.
array_write(+D)      % Writes info about D to the current output stream.
array_write(+S,+D)   % Writes info about D to the stream S.
array_as_list(+D,-L) % Converts the array D to a list L of Idx-T pairs.
current_array(-D)    % Generates (through backtracking) all the existing
                     %   arrays.
arrays               % Shows all existing arrays.

IMPERATIVE BUFFERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the following predicates, B stands for a buffer (a new kind of primitive
type) or for an ivar bound to a buffer.

A buffer is a specialized array which stores small integers in the range
0..255 (bytes). A buffer grows automatically, as needed. The store and retrieve
operations are very fast and performed in constant time.

Unlike the arrays, the value associated with an index that has not been assigned
is automatically zero. Therefore the retrieve operation - buffer_get/1 -
never fails.

CxProlog supports opening a stream over a buffer in order to perform sequential
reads and writes using the normal input/output operations.

CxProlog also supports reading large chunks of information from a

to a file.

buffer(+B)          % B is a buffer.
buffer_new(-B)      % Creates a new buffer B.
buffer_clear(+B)    % Clears the buffer B.
buffer_delete(+B)   % Deletes the buffer B.
buffer_size(+B,-No,+Nn)
					% Queries and changes the size of the buffer B. The old size

HANDLING TRANSIENT TEXT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In CxProlog, the recommended way of dealing with transient text is
through atoms, with the help of predicates get_line/1, get_line/2,
concat/2 and slice/4. These predicates are very flexible and CxProlog
includes a garbage collector of atoms that safely recycles again
and again the space taken by transient text.

slice(+A,+Na,+Nb,-Asub)
                    % Asub is the subatom of atom A that includes the
                    %   characters of A between offsets Na and Nb. These
                    %   offsets are relative to the beginning of A, if
                    %   they are both positive, and are relative to the
                    %   ending of A, if they are both negative.
                    %   Examples:
                    %      slice('ABC',1,1,AS) --> As='A'
                    %      slice('ABC',-2,-1,AS) --> As='BC'.
concat(+L,-A)       % Takes the textual representations of all the terms
                    %   in L and concatenates everything into the returned
                    %   atom A. Sublists in L are subjected to the
                    %   recursive application of concat/2. Example:
                    %   ?- concat(['ole ',f(a),z,[[a]]],X), writeln(X).
                    %   ole f(a)za
                    %   X='ole f(a)za'
-A === +L           % Same as concat(+L,-A). Note the reversed order of the
						parameters, comparing with concat/2. This is because we
						want ===/2 to be used as a kind of assignment operator.


THREADS (coroutines)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the following predicates, Z stands for a thread (a new kind of
primitive type) or for an ivar bound to a thread.

The threads are organised in TREE. Killing a thread also kills all
its descendants

thread(+Z)          % Z is a thread.
thread_new(-Z, +Goal, +RestartGoal)
                    % Creates a new thread Z. Goal is the startup goal.
                    %   RestartGoal is the goal that is activated
                    %   in case of error or explicit restart/0 call.
thread_transfer(+Z,-A)
                    % Transfers control to the thread Z. Possible results
                    %   are: 'going','completed','failed','killed','error'.
thread_kill(+Z)     % Kills the thread Z.
active_thread(-Z)   % Z is the active thread.
active_thread_completed
                    % Finishes the active thread making it return
                    %   'completed'.
active_thread_failed
                    % Finishes the active thread making it return 'failed'.
current_thread(-Z)  % Generates (through backtracking) all the existing
                    %   threads.
threads             % Shows all existing threads.

SOCKETS
~~~~~~~
These four predicates enable CxProlog to act either as a server or as a
client over an Internet link.

The first three are "server predicates". As a piece of advice, it is a good
idea to span a new process with the purpose of handling each incoming
connection. This way the client does not have to wait too long.

The last predicate is the sole "client predicate".


net_install(+N)     % Activates a local server socket listening to port N.
                    %   Only one server per process is supported.
net_uninstall       % Closes the local server socket.
net_accept(-S1,-S2) % Waits for the next incoming connection and then opens
                    %    two streams for handling the communication.
                    %    S1 is the input stream where the requests arrive.
                    %    S2 is the output stream to where the replies are sent.
net_connect(+A,+N,-S1,-S2)
                    % Connects, as a client, to the server A, port N, and
                    %   open two streams to handle the communication.
                    %   S1 is the input stream where the replies arrive.
                    %   S2 is the output stream to where the requests are sent.

PROCESSES (experimental)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the following predicates, P stands for a process (a new kind of
primitive type) or for an ivar bound to a thread.

NOTE: These predicates only work under Unix. They are implemented using the
Unix primitives 'fork', 'pipe', 'write' and 'read'.

The father process may create as many child processes as it wishes.
The father process cannot kill any of its child processes.
But a child process can kill itself using halt/0 or exit/0.

There is a private unidirectional channel of communications between each
child and father. Messages are nonnegative integer number.

Internally, some negative numbers may also be send through the channel, for
bookkeeping purposes. For example, when a child dies, the message -1 is
passed to the father, instructing it to set the child descriptor
to "not-alive" state. This update is automatic.

process(+P)         % P is a process.
process_new(-P, +Goal, +RestartGoal)
                    % Creates a new child process P. Goal is the startup goal.
                    %   RestartGoal is the goal that is activated
                    %   in case of error or explicit restart/0 call.
process_send_father(+N)
                    % Child sends message N to its father.
                    % N is a nonnegative integer.
process_send_father_max(-N)
                    % N is the number of consecutive sends that puts
                    % the system in a dead-lock state, if the father
                    % never reads the messages.
process_receive_from_child(-P,-N)
                    % Father receives message N from its child process P.
                    % This is a blocking primitive: if there is no message
                    % available, the father waits. N is a nonnegative integer.
process_receive_from_child_ready
                    % Non-blocking primitive that checks whether or not
                    % there is a message available.
current_process(-P) % Generates (through backtracking) all the existing
                    %   child processes.
processes_clean_dead % Discard the dead.
processes           % Shows all the child processes.

DEBUGGER
~~~~~~~~
The debugger is described in a separated section. Here, we present only
the debugger predicates. Here they are:

debug               % Switches "debug mode" on. The debugger will
                    %    trace the execution of the first encountered
                    %    predicate with a spy-point set. Equivalent to
                    %    flag(debug,_,1).
trace               % Switches "trace mode" on. The debugger will
                    %    trace the execution of the first encountered
                    %    non-builtin predicate (even if it has not a
                    %    spy-point set. This allows exhaustive
                    %    tracing of a program. Equivalent to
                    %    flag(debug,_,2).
nodebug             % Switches debug mode off and removes all spy-points.
                         Equivalent to flag(debug,_,0).
notrace             % Same as nodebug/0.
debugging           % Displays information concerning the current state of
                    %    debugger, including the list of active spy-points
                    %    and the current leashing mode.
leash(Mode)         % Sets "leashing mode" to Mode, where Mode is one of
                    %    the following atoms:
                    %      'full'  - prompt on call, exit, next, fail
                    %      'tight' - prompt on call, next, fail
                    %      'half'  - prompt on call, next
                    %      'loose' - prompt on call
                    %      'off'   - no prompt
                    %      DEFAULT = 'half'
                    %    When an event causes the debugger to display
                    %    information, if that event is "leashed"
                    %    then the debugger stops there to allow user to
                    %    interact.]
                    %    The events 'redo' and 'cut' cannot be leashed.
spy Spec            % Sets spy-points on all predicates described by Spec.
                    %   Spec can be an atom, a functor or a list of atoms
                    %   and functors. All events associated with a
                    %   predicate with a spy-point set, will force the
                    %   debugger to prompt the user (even if leashing is
                    %   off).
nospy Spec          % Removes the spy-point for the predicates given by Spec.
nospyall            % Removes all spy-points from all predicates.

Customising CxProlog

ALTERNATIVE BOOT FILES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is possible to specify an alternative boot file, using the command
line argument '-boot'. Another method is to invoke the C-function
'SpecifyBootFile(.)' from inside C-function 'YourPrologue()', as in
SpecifyBootFile("MyBootFile.pl").

Through the definition of a boot file, the user is able to customise the
following aspects of the CxProlog system:

   - Replace the default top-level user-iteration;
   - Add extra builtin predicates written in Prolog: all predicates
     defined inside the boot file, or loaded from commands issued inside
     the boot file, are taken as builtin;
   - Redefine predefined builtin predicates: it is necessary to issue
     an abolish_builtin/2 command, prior to each such redefinition;
   - Add MUTABLE extra builtin predicates: they are declared in the
     boot file via predicate mutable_builtin/2.

Every alternative boot file MUST provide a definition for the following
two predicates:

'$cxprolog_initialise'
                    % Perform any initialisation that might be required. 
                    %    It is activated on startup.
'$cxprolog_top_level_goal'
                    % Perform the top-level user-iteration concerning a
                    %   SINGLE goal. It is reactivated again and again
                    %   after every:
                    %     - top-goal completion;
                    %     - explicit 'restart/0' or 'abort/0' call;
                    %     - error message
                    %     - CNTL-C interrupt (depending on the status of
                    %       the 'interrupt' flag).

These predicates may fail or succeed after doing their job. It doesn't
matter.

Nothing else is required or assumed by CxProlog, concerning alternative
boot files.

The accompanying file "CxBoot.pl" serves as an example of a simple boot
file. Actually, the contents of this file match the default used by
CxProlog when no boot file is provided (see DEFAULT BOOT).

DEFAULT BOOT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Missing the conventional command line argument '-boot' (or a
'SpecifyBootFile' C-function invocation) CxProlog does not load any
boot file whatsoever. Instead, it installs a default top-level
interaction oriented toward program development.

There are some minor builtin predicates introduced in the default boot:

push +U             % Pushes the unit designator U on top of current
                    %   context. Therefore changes the current unit
                    %   to be used in the top-level iteration.
pop                 % Pops the current context. Therefore restores the
                    %   previous current unit, which will be used in
                    %   the top-level iteration

ADDING BUILTIN PREDICATED WRITTEN IN C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is done via the function YourExtensions() inside file YourExtensions.c.
This file contains several cautionary notes and guidelines useful for
creating new builtin predicates written in C.

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

The Debugger

The debugger predicates are described in the builtin predicates section.

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The CxProlog debugger is based on the classical "procedure box" control
flow model: during execution, at each procedure call, the debugger builds
a box - called "procedure box" - containing a copy of the invoked predicate.
Each procedure box includes four ports named "call", "exit", "redo"
and "fail".

During execution the debugger keeps building procedure boxes so that the
flow of control could proceeds through their ports. Each kind of port
is transversed (entered or exited) in the following circumstances:
  call - entered on predicate activation;
  exit - exited on success;
  redo - entered on backtracking (so to consider the next alternative);
  fail - exited on failure (when there are no alternatives left).

Control transversing a port generates a "port event" that makes the
debugger display a line of debugging information. The two other
kinds of events CxProlog considers - "cut events" and "next events" - occur
inside the procedure boxes and are activated in the following circumstances:
  cut - when the control directive !/0 is executed, in a clause;
  next - when, after "deep backtracking" (via a "redo" port) the next
         clause is tried; "shallow backtracking" (inside the box)
         does not generate next events.

The debugger allows the user to creep (single-step) through the
debugging events while they are generated. But this is bound to produce
too much information. The commands "skip" and "leap" allow the user to
trim unwanted information:
 - "skip" focus on information concerning a specific procedure
   box (usually the current one);
 - "leap" focus on information concerning some predicates of
   interest, previously marked with "spy-points".

Important rules concerning builtin predicates:

- The internal execution of a builtin predicate is untraceable.
  In other words, the box of a builtin predicate is a "black box"
  for debugging purposes: what's happening inside cannot be seen.
- The internal execution of an user predicate is always traceable,
  even if the user predicate is activated from a builtin predicate.
- Spy-points can be placed on user predicates, but not on builtin
  predicates.

DEBUGGING LINE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this small three clause program:

   z:-a,!,fail.
   z.
   a.

Here is the result of single-stepping through this program, in trace
mode, with a spy-point placed on a/0, and with leashing set to "half": 

(trace) [main] ?- z.
  2 (  1) call: [main]: z ?
 * 1 (  2) call: [main]: a ?
 * 1 (  2) exit: [main]: a ?
  0 (  1)  cut: [main]: z
   b (  3) call: [main]: fail ?
   b (  3) fail: [main]: fail
  0 (  1) next: [main]: z ?
  0 (  1) fail: [main]: z
no

This is the meaning of each component of the debugging line:

 Component 1 [char]:
       b - builtin predicate;
       i - imported predicate;
       u - predicate undefined in the current unit;
   0..9# - number of remaining clauses, not yet considered in the
           execution of an user-defined predicate (# represents
           number >= 10) ;
 Component 2 [char]:
       * - spy-point;
 Component 3 [char]:
       > - marks an event that was not reached by single-stepping.
           The alternatives:
              - point of return from a 'skip' command;
              - point of return from a leap command;
              - point where a CNTR-C interrupted activated the debugger,
              - point where a CNTR-C forced the debugger to stop
                skipping or leaping.
 Component 4 [number in parenthesis]:
      Unique invocation identifier that is associated with each procedure box.
      The invocation identifier is incremented for every fresh invocation
      that is displayed by the debugger. In other words, it is
      incremented whenever a call event shows up on the console.
      Some commands accept an invocation identifier as argument (see below).
 Component 5 [event type]:
      Type of the event that caused the line to be displayed.
 Component 6 [context]:
      The current context
 Component 7 [goal]:
      The current goal, printed using the current instantiation state.
 Component 8 [char]:
       ? - prompt, if necessary, for a debugging command. The debugging
           commands are described next.

DEBUGGING COMMANDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The debugging commands are one letter mnemonic, optionally followed
by a positive integer argument. Here is a description of all the
available debugging commands:

Command 'h' [help]:
 Displays this menu of available debugging commands:  

   CxProlog interrupt/debug options:
         <ret> creep            l leap             h help
          s<i> skip             + spy this         i info
          q<i> quasi-skip       - nospy this    g<n> ancestors
          r<i> retry            n nodebug          = debugging
          f<i> fail             a abort            : statistics
                                e exit

Command <ret> creep:
   Continue execution, displaying debugging information for all the events,
until a leashed event is reached. If leashing if off, a complete trace of
the execution is given.

Command s<i> skip:
   Continue execution, omitting all debugging information, until the next
event concerned with the port <i> is reached. Argument <i> is optional:
if not given, the identifier of the current box is used.

Command q<i> quasi-skip:
   Combination of "skip" and "leap". Continue execution, omitting all
debugging information, until the next event concerned with the port <i>
OR with a predicate with a spy-point is reached. Argument <i> is optional:
if not given, the identifier of the current box is used.

Command r<i> retry:
   Execution is transferred back to the call port of box <i>, so an 
earlier state of computation is resumed. Argument <i> is optional:
if not given, the identifier of the current box is used.

Command f<i> fail:
   Execution is transferred to the fail port of box <i>. This amounts to
manually fail the invocation associated with box <i>. Argument <i> is
optional: the default is the identifier of the current box.

Command n nodebug:
   Turn off debug mode. Equivalent to the predicate nodebug/0.

Command l leap:
   Continue execution, omitting all debugging information, until the next
event concerned with a predicate with a spy-point is reached.
By leaping throughout predicates with spy-points, the user can follow
the execution at a higher level than exhaustive tracing.

Command + spy this:
   Place a spy-point on the predicate in the current box.

Command - nospy this:
   Remove any spy-point from the predicate in the current box.

Command a abort:
   Abort execution. Equivalent to the predicates restart/0 and abort/0.

Command e exit:
   Exit CxProlog. Equivalent to predicate halt/0.

Command i info:
   Shows information about the current goal and corresponding predicate,
about the current context and about the current historic context. 

Command g<n> ancestors:
   Displays, in the current instantiation state, the goal that called the
current one, then the one that called it, and so on. Some ancestors may
be missing because only goals with associated procedure box are shown.
Note that while skipping or leaping (see commands "skip" and "leap"), no
procedure box is built.

Command = debugging:
   Show the current debugging state. Equivalent to predicate debugging/0.

Command : statistics:
   Show runtime information. Equivalent to predicate statistics/0.

Writing CxProlog scripts for Unix

A CxProlog script is an executable text file starting with this line

  #!/usr/local/bin/cxprolog -script

Use the command "chmod u+x myscript" to make a script file executable.

A script is run by simply writing its name in the Unix command line: CxProlog
is automatically activated, then it "consults" the script and finally exits
silently. Note that scripts must contain at least one command: otherwise
no operation is performed when they run.

Scripts are supposed to take advantage of the builtin predicates that provide
interface to the operating system, including the very general predicate
system/2. Note that handling the output of commands issued through system/2
can best be done using the tokenizer (accessible through read_tokens/1 and
read_tokens/2).

SAMPLE SCRIPT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#!/usr/local/bin/cxprolog -script

% Displays the PID of all processes with "log" as part of their name.

run_script :-
    system('ps -A | grep log > /tmp/aux'),
    open('/tmp/aux', read, S), read_pids(S, Ps), close(S),
    writeln(Ps).

read_pids(S, Ps) :-
    read_tokens(S,T),
    (T == end_of_file
        -> Ps=[]
        ; T=[const_tk(P)|_], Ps=[P|Z], read_pids(S,Z)).

:- run_script.

APPENDIX: Some technical information


*Index rules:
When first called, every predicate is assumed to be static and its
index is built. But ifIf the predicate is changed afterwards
(using retract or assert) then the predicate is now considered dynamic
and its index removed. A dynamic predicate has no index because it
would be too inefficient to keep rebuilding the index again and again.


*Permanent/temporary atoms rules:
Atoms occurring in clauses are internally kept as 'permanent atoms'.
Ivar names are internally kept as 'permanent atoms'.
Unit names are internally kept as 'permanent atoms'.
Operator names are internally kept as 'permanent atoms'.
Predicate names are internally kept as 'permanent atoms'.
All other atoms are kept as 'temporary atoms'.

There is a garbage collector of temporary atoms that safely recycles
again and again the space taken by transient text.


*Memory reserved rules:
Each C-builtin predicate can count on a 512 word memory reserve in the stacks.
Between any two pred calls there is a 512 word memory reserve in the stacks.
