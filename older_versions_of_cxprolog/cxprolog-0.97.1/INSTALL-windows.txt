CXPROLOG INSTALLATION PROCEDURE FOR WINDOWS
===========================================



* INSTALLING

Use the provided installer.

Please do not mess with the relative positions of the files inside the
application folder because those positions are important for some features
of CxProlog to work, like accessing libraries or using the Java interface.



* CUSTOMIZE THE CONSOLE

You need to customize the console where CxProlog runs to properly display
non-ansi characters (e.g. accented characters)! Simply select a no-raster
font, e.g. Lucida, in the Properties menu of the console.



* PREPARE FOR JAVA

For the Java interface to work, you have to install jdk-1.5.0, or a newer
version, and you need to setup the PATH environment variable to make the
command 'javac' and the library 'jvm.dll' accessible from CxProlog. Please
don't move files around; change only the PATH variable by extending it
with something like this:

"C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.5.0/bin;C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.5.0/jre/bin/client"

Beware that CxProlog initializes the Java interface only when a Java
predicate is called for the first time. So a Java instalation problem
may go unnoticed for sometime. To check if the Java interface is working
you can use the predicate "java_check/0".



Enjoy using CxProlog.
