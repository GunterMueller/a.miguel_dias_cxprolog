   CXPROLOG INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE CODE

 APPLIES TO LINUX, MAC OS X & WINDOWS(MINGW)
=============================================



* BUILDING

The following command builds a bare bones executable CxProlog, with
all the optional components disabled:

    make



* ACTIVATING OPTIONAL COMPONENTS

To activate optional components during the building process, you need
to supply extra arguments to the "make" command. The available options are:

	READLINE=y	
		Adds support for command-line editing and command line history,
        using the GNU readline library.

	JAVA=y
		Adds a JNI-based external interface for Java.

	WXWIDGETS=y
		Adds an external interface for the wxWidgets  platform independent API.
		
To activate everything at the same time, the full command is:

	make READLINE=y JAVA=y WXWIDGETS=y



* CLEANING

This removes all the mess created by the compiler:

    make clean



* TESTING

The following command checks if CxProlog" operates correctly on your machine:

    make test



* INSTALLING

The following command installs the CxProlog files in the default directory
"/usr/local" (this may require  superuser privileges):

    make install

To install in a different directory, e.g. "/usr/bin", use the PREFIX option
as in:

    make install PREFIX=/usr



Enjoy using CxProlog.

   MINGW INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS OS
======================================

MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows), is a native software port of GCC to
Microsoft Windows, along with a set of import libraries and header files for
the Windows API.

MinGW allows the creation of native Windows applications. MinGW does not
require a compatibility layer DLL. MinGW, always uses direct Win32-API calls.

The lattest version of MinGW is always available here:
