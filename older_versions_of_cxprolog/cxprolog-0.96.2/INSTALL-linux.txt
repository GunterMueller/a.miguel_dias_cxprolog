CXPROLOG INSTALLATION PROCEDURE FOR LINUX & MAC OS X
====================================================

The installation is made using the source distribution.


* BUILDING

The following command builds a bare bones executable CxProlog, with
no optional components activated:

    make



* ACTIVATING OPTIONAL COMPONENTS

To activate optional components during the building process, you need
to supply extra arguments to the "make" command. Aa now the available
options are:

	USE_READLINE=y	
		Adds support for command-line editing and command line history,
        using the GNU readline library.

	USE_JAVA=y
		Adds a JNI-based external interface for Java.

	USE_WXWIDGETS=y
		Adds an external interface for the wxWidgets  platform independent API.
		
To activate everything at the same time, the full command is:

	make USE_READLINE=y USE_JAVA=y USE_WXWIDGETS=y



* CLEANING

This removes all the mess created by the compiler:

    make clean



* TESTING

The following command checks if CxProlog" operates correctly on your machine:

    make test



* INSTALLING

The following command installs the CxProlog files in the default directory
"/usr/local" (this may require  superuser privileges):

    make install

To install in a different directory, e.g. "/usr/bin", use the PREFIX option
as in:

    make install PREFIX=/usr/bin



Enjoy using CxProlog.
