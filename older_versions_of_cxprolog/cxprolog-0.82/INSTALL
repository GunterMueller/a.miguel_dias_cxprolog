CXPROLOG INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==================================

Installation of the source distribution
----------------------------------------

To create in the current directory the executable "cxprolog"
do the following:

    cd src
    make

To make it sure that "cxprolog" operates correctly on your particular
machine, do the following:

    make test

To install "cxprolog" in "/usr/bin", do the following (in
superuser mode):

    make install

If you prefer to install "cxprolog" elsewhere, e.g. inside
"/usr/local/cxprolog", simply edit the file Makefile and change
the PREFIX definition. Then run the previous command.

After installing "cxprolog", it is a good idea to save disk space
by removing all the "mess" created by the compiler. Do the following:

    make clean


Enjoy using cxprolog.
